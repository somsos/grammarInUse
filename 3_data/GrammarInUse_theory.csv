Explain Present Perfect
"|"
When we say ‘something has happened’, this is usually new information:
--I’ve cut my finger.
--The road is closed. There’s been an accident
--Police have arrested two men in connection with the robbery

There is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:
--He told me his name, but I’ve forgotten it
--She is still here. She hasn’t gone out
--I didn't find my bag. Have you seen it? 

Compare:
--He has gone to Italy. (=He is there now or on his way there)
--She has been to Italy. (=She has now come back)

Explain Present Perfect Continuous

"|"
We use the present perfect continuous for

--An activity that has recently stopped or just stopped:
----[I’ve == I have] been talking to Amanda and she agrees with me
----Why are you out of breath? Have you been running?
----Where have you been?. I’ve been looking for you

--Period of time using for example, 1)for 2)how long and 3)since,
----[He’s==He has] been watching TV For 3 hours.
----How long have you been learning English?
----Since when haven't you been Spanish? I've never been!.

--for repeated actions:
----She is good at tennis. She’s been playing since she was eight.
----They meet in the same cafe. They’ve been going there for years.

I am doing VS I have been doing:
--I am doing
----1)Don’t disturb me now. I’m working.
----2)We need an umbrella. It’s raining.
----3)Hurry up! We’re waiting.

--I've been doing
----1)I’ve been working hard. Now I’m going to have a break.

Differences between Present perfect continuous and simple

1)Example painting

"|"

Present perfect continuous
--There is paint on Kate’s clothes. She has been painting her bedroom.
--The Activity has not been finished.
--We are thinking of the activity. It does not matter
--whether it has been finished or not

Present perfect
--The bedroom was green. Now it is yellow. She has painted her bedroom
--The action has finished.
--We are thinking about the result of the activity not the activity itself.


We use the continuous to say how long (for something that is still happening)
--1a)How long have you been reading that book?
--2a)He is writing emails. She’s been writing emails all morning.
--3a)They’ve been playing tennis since 2 o’clock.
--4a)I’m learning Arabic, but I haven’t been learning it very long.

We use the simple to say how much, how many or how many times (for completed actions):
--1b)How many pages of that book have you read?
--2b)She has sent lots of emails this morning.
--3b)They ’ve played tennis three times this week.
--4b)I’m learning Arabic, but I haven’t learnt very much yet.

PRESENT PERFECT
--Example:
----‘Tom has lost his key’ = he doesn’t have his key now 
--Description:
----The present perfect (something has happened) is a present tense. It tells us about the situation now.

PAST SIMPLE
--Example
----Timmy lost his key
--Description
The past simple tells us only about the past, we don’t know whether Timmy has the key now or not. We know only that he lost it at some time in the past.

#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit 17 have and have got

I used to play tennis a lot, but I don’t play very much now.
‘Do you go to the cinema much?’ ‘Not now, but I used to.’ (= I used to go)

We also use used to ... for things that were true, but are not true any more:
This building is now a furniture shop. It used to be a cinema.
=
XXX








‘I used to do something’ is past. There is no present. You cannot say ‘I use to do’.

#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit19 Present tenses (I am doing / I do) for the future




I’m doing something (tomorrow etc.) = I have already decided and arranged to do it:
a: What are you doing on Saturday evening? (not What do you do)



Puede usar el presente simple para hablar sobre las personas si sus planes se solucionan como un horario: comienzo mi nuevo trabajo el lunes.
You can use the present simple to talk about people if their plans are fixed like a timetable: I start my new job on Monday.


We do not normally use will to talk about what we have arranged to do:
Alex is getting married next month. (not will get)





We also use the present continuous for an action just before you start to do it. This happens
especially with verbs of movement (go/come/leave etc.):
I’m tired. I’m going to bed now. Goodnight. (not I go to bed now)
‘Tina, are you ready yet?’ ‘Yes, I’m coming.’ (not I come)






#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit21 will and shall 1


We do not use will to talk about what has been decided or arranged before:
I’m going on holiday next Saturday. (not I’ll go)




We use shall mostly in the questions shall I ... ? / shall we ... ?
We use shall I ... ? / shall we ... ? to ask if it’s OK to do something or to ask for a suggestion:
Shall I open the window? (= do you want me to open it?)
I’ve got no money. What shall I do? (= what do you suggest?)
‘Shall we go?’ ‘Just a minute. I’m not ready yet.’
‘Where shall we have lunch?’ ‘Let’s go to Marino’s.’

Are you going to watch TV this evening? (not will you watch)
We use will to say what we know or believe about the future
He is predicting the future.
Do you think Kate will pass?. Yes, she’s a good driver. She’ll pass easily.





We often use will (’ll) with:
=
probably, I’m sure, I think, I don’t think, I wonder











Draw two lines one illustrating we would be the 'will' and another where would be the 'going to', of the next conversation
A:Let’s have a party.
B:That’s a great idea We’ll invite lots of people.
Then-B:Sarah and I have decided to have a party. We’re going to invite lots of people.

Amy: I’ll call you again later when I arrive.
The time is future, but Amy says:when I arrive (not when I will arrive)
The same thing happens aft er while / before / after / as soon as / until:




#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit26 can, could and (be) able to




We use could for general ability and with see, hear etc. :
--My grandfather could speak five languages.
--I could see them, but not very clearly.
But to say that somebody succeeded in doing something in a specific situation, we normally use was/were able to or managed to (not could):
--The fire spread quickly, but everybody was able to escape. (not could escape)
--I didn’t know where Max was, but I managed to find him in the end. (not could find)








#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit27 could (do) and could have (done)

make suggestions. For example:





We also use could (not can) for actions that are not realistic. For example:
I’m so tired, I could sleep for a week. (not I can sleep for a week)





Compare can and could:
I can stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (realistic)
Maybe I could stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (possible, but less sure)
This is a wonderful place. I could stay here for ever. (unrealistic)


#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit28 must and can’t





#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit29  may and might 1





You are looking for Ben. Nobody is sure where he is, but you get some suggestions.
--Where’s Ben?. He may be in his office.
We use may or might to say that something is possible. You can use may or might:
--It may be true. or It might be true.






Note the difference between may be (2 words) and maybe (1 word):
It may be true. (may + verb)
‘Is it true?’ ‘Maybe. I’m not sure.’ (maybe = it’s possible, perhaps)








For the past we use may have ... or might have ...






#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit30 may and might 2


We use may and might to talk about possible actions or happenings in the future:
--I haven’t decided where to go on holiday. I may go to Ireland. (= perhaps I will go there)
--Take an umbrella with you. It might rain later. (= perhaps it will rain)
--The bus isn’t always on time. We might have to wait a few minutes. (= perhaps we will have to wait)

--Amy may not go out tonight. She isn’t feeling well. (= perhaps she will not go out)
--There might not be enough time to discuss everything at the meeting. (= perhaps there will not be enough time)

Compare:
--I’m going to buy a car. (for sure)

But we use might (not may) when the situation is not real:
--If they paid me better, I might work harder. (not I may work)





#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit31 have to and must







I have to do something = it is necessary to do it, I am obliged to do it: and
'must' is pretty similar But we use must in written rules and instructions:



You mustn’t do something = don’t do it:
--You must keep this a secret. You mustn’t tell anyone. (= don’t tell anyone)
--I promised I would be on time. I mustn’t be late. (= I must be on time)
You don’t have to do something = you don’t need to do it (but you can if you want):
--You don’t have to come with me. I can go alone.
--I don’t have to be at the meeting, but I’m going anyway.




#■■■■■■■■■■■■ Unit32 must mustn’t needn’t


must and mustn’t
--it is necessary that you do it:

--We use had better only for a specific situation, not for things in general
----It’s late. You’d better go. or You should go. (a specific situation)
----You’re always at home. You should go out more often. (in general – not ‘had better go’)
